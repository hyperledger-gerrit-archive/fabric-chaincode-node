v1.4.1 March 29, 2019
-----------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
Fabric 1.4.1 builds upon the new programming model introduced in Fabric 1.4. 0.
Specific addtions include

- Updates to the context object to provide contract developers with an easy to use logging system. Rather than console.log
- Updates to the @Param and @Return annotation to generate beta metadata
- The `fabric-chaincod-node metadata generate` command can be run to obtain a local copy of the metadata for augmentation


Summary of the programming model
-------------------------------

This is designed to improve developer productivity and ease of use.
A new NPM package `fabric-contract-api` is added that lets the developer focus on the functions they want to invoke
within the chaincode. They can also modularize their applications into 'Contracts' by extending a Contract class.

See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/developapps/developing_applications.html

To help client applications, and tooling and to make working with the transaction functions easier, a defined
schema of Contract Metadata has been introduced. Depending on language a large part of this can be automatically created.
Typescript Annotations are provided that are very useful in creating this data.

See https://fabric-shim.github.io/contract-schema.json


On the client application side, a new NPM package `fabric-network` is added which contains the classes and methods for writing
blockchain enabled applications in node.js using javascript or typescript.

See https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/module-fabric-network.html
